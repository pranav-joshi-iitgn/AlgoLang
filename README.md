This is a programming language that I built during the 6th semester at IITGN.
It has nice features like addition of "algorithms",lexical scoping,lists, dictionaries,etc.
There is a functionality for syntax highlighting as well.
It lacks massively in debugging as of now.

This is an example exectution:

```sh
python3 RUN.py sample7.txt
```

Output:
