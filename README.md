This is a programming language that I built during the 6th semester at IITGN.
It has nice features like addition of "algorithms",dynamic scoping,lists, dictionaries,etc using a tree-walk interpreter.
There is a functionality for syntax highlighting as well, using the `algsyn` VS-code extension, and the `RUN.py` script.
It compiles to MIPS32, although most of the features are only present in the interpreter.
